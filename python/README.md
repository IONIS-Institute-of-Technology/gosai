# gosai-py

Python runtime for GOSAI: the driver bridge process and the Python SDK
(`gosai_py`) used by apps that need ML/CV/audio processing.

## Setup

```bash
uv sync
uv sync --extra cv --extra audio   # add optional groups as needed
```

## Run the bridge directly (for development)

```bash
uv run gosai-bridge
```

The bridge reads newline-delimited JSON requests from stdin and writes
responses/events to stdout. It is normally spawned by the GOSAI server.
